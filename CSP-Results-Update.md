900 corals, 450 *M. capitata* and 450 *P. acuta*, were collected from 6 sites in Kaneohe Bay, Hawai'i. These corals were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatments. 3 tanks per treatment, 12 tanks total. 2 months of treatment and 2 months of recovery in ambient conditions.   

ATAC = Ambient Temperature (27C) Ambient pCO2 (~480 uatm)  
ATHC = Ambient Temperature (27C) High pCO2 (~1,200 uatm)    
HTAC = High Temperature (29.5C) Ambient pCO2 (~480 uatm)  
HTHC = High Temperature (29.5C) High pCO2 (~1,200 uatm)

### Experimental Treatments

**Hobo Logger Data**

Emma needs to parse hobo logger data for times they were out of the water and then will put an updated version here.

**Discrete Temperature and pH Measurements**

To be placed here from version in CSP.

**Discrete Carbonate Chemistry**

To be placed here from version in CSP.

### Physiological data

Only what is to be included in Coral Stress Phenome paper. Link to results package from HoloInt [here](https://github.com/hputnam/Acclim_Dynamics/blob/master/HoloInt-Results-package.md).

#### Survivorship

Figure as of 2021-05-27. For now these are just copied from HoloInt repo.

#### Color Score

Corals were photographed every week until sampled.

![bl](https://github.com/hputnam/Coral_Stress_Phenome/blob/main/Physiology-data/Photographic_Bleaching_20210527.png?raw=true)

#### Multivariate physiology  

Emma to re-run TAC, modify script, and re-run PCA analysis. Will insert here when done.

This will have to re-run once more when symbiont density counts are done.

### Statistics

**Mcap multivariate physiology**

PERMANOVA

```
Will insert once updated
```

**Pacuta multivariate physiology**

PERMANOVA

```
Will insert once updated
```

### ITS2 Sequencing

Emma to re-run ITS2 analysis once more and insert once updated.

PERMANOVA results:

```
Will insert once updated
```

### 16s Sequencing

Samples are at the URI Genome Sequencing Center being processed.

### Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing

60 Pacuta from 5 time points in processing in lab at URI. Estimated ship date to sequencing center = June 14th.
