[2021-02-10 07:17:14.680] [jointLog] [info] Counted 5,263,182 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2021-02-10 07:17:14.686] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0227863% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
